Winston Churchill famously said, “never stand up when you can sit”.  Well, Winston Churchill never had to use a porta potty on day 4 of a music festival or use the stadium bathroom during halftime of a football game.  Mr. Churchill was also able to urinate standing up (or so we assume).  Women account for 50% of the world’s population who don’t have that luxury….or at least they didn’t until now. 
After years of squatting over disgusting toilets in bars, restaurants and dorms or simply holding it in due to the unsanitary conditions at stadiums, festivals and at parties, there is now a solution.  I introduce to you the ppack cone. 
The ppack cone is a disposable biodegradable paper cone which is designed to allow women to easily and effectively urinate while standing.  You will never need to come into physical contact with a disgusting toilet ever again.  Simply pop open the cone with your fingers, place the cone close to your body and aim at the toilet while standing.  When you are done, simply toss the disposable ppack cone in the garbage. It is clean, simple, and extremely effective.  
The ppack cone is also a must-have for outdoor activities such as camping, hiking and biking where sanitary bathrooms are few and far between.  The ppack cone is made of a thick card stock but is lightweight and compact enough to fit easily and discretely in your purse or your car.  Always keep a few ppack cones near-by as you never know when you will need them.  
With all due respect to Mr. Churchill, “never sit when you can stand”.
